<h2 class="title">Hey there!</h2>
  <p>My name is Aseem Athale, also known on the Internet as mistersmee and this website is still under construction, so stuff may or may not look the same the next time you visit. Also, not sure what I'll put on here, probably some blog articles of me rambling on about programming or Linux or tech in general or something.</p>

  <h2 id="Articles">Articles</h2>
  <ul class="articles">
  {% set section = get_section(path="blog/_index.md") %}
  {% for page in section.pages %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ page.permalink | safe }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
    <p class="date">{{ page.date }}</p>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
