## Welcome to my blog!

I've always wanted to have my own website and blog and all the homelab stuff since forever, but since I was a broke college student and school student before that, I was not in a state to follow through on that. But now, since I've graduated and am employed, I have some income (even though it's fresher-level income at my salary) to put towards stuff like this.



I'm still not sure what I'll put on here, maybe my notes or rambles on whatever topic interests me at the time of posting, maybe my adventures with some cool tech or program, or my progress with getting better at programming and exploring Linux or Rust or whatever. Let's see though.


But, yeah, this is just the equivalent of the empty or nearly empty "Initial commit" to a code repo.


Bis bald, Tschüss!
